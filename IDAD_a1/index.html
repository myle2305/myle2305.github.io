    <h3>Information Design</h3>
    <div class="Container">
      <div class="Seven-poems">
        <h4>7 Poems</h4>
        <p>
          In "7 Poems", the artist created a clean, minimalist layout to avoid
          overloading information for users. Text gradually appears, line by
          line, as we click on the available green boxes, allowing us to focus
          our attention on each part of the story. By not using distracting
          elements like colorful images or animations, this website helps users
          have a deep experience and be focused on the story being told.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Liquid-entrophy">
        <h4>Liquid Entrophy</h4>
        <p>
          In contrast to the informational purpose of "7 Poems", "Liquid
          Entrophy" aims to create an environment for users to experience the
          tool. Therefore, the author has eliminated the usual information
          design, without specific instructional text. This helps users focus on
          the tool experience and encourages them to feel rather than receive
          information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="Conclusion">
        While "7 Poems" has a carefully organized layout that guides viewers to
        focus on receiving information, "Liquid Entropy" allows users to explore
        and experience the tool in their own way. This contrast is due to the
        difference in the purpose that the website author wants to aim for.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Mapping</h3>
    <div class="Container">
      <div class="Seven-poems">
        <h4>7 Poems</h4>
        <p>
          Mapping in "7 Poems" is straightforward: clicking on the neatly
          arranged blue boxes on the screen to progress the story. The linear
          interaction ensures that the user always stays on track with the
          author’s intention. This keeps the user's experience of consuming
          information consistent and narrative.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Liquid-entrophy">
        <h4>Liquid Entrophy</h4>
        <p>
          "Liquid Entropy's" mapping is spatial and gestural. The website lets
          users create 3D abstract graphics and sounds by moving cursors. They
          also are allowed to adjust the feedback sound through the tool panel
          located on the right side of the screen. This arrangement prioritizes
          experience and exploration, and at the same time makes it easy to
          adjust the sound according to the user's expectations. This kind of
          mapping prioritizes immersion and creativity rather than practical
          use.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="Conclusion">
        While "7 Poems" uses simple mapping to maintain narrative flow, "Liquid
        Entropy" uses open-ended mapping to create an interactive space.
      </p>

    <h3>Characterisation</h3>
    <div class="Container">
      <div class="Seven-poems">
        <h4>7 Poems</h4>
        <p>
          In “7 Poems”, the interface’s characterisation is minimalist with the
          monochrome palette, centered text, and lack of decorative elements
          makes it formal. Interaction is quite slow and deliberate, each click
          reveals a small portion of text, creating a pace. In general, the
          interface is serious and intimate, which matches the emotionally heavy
          subject matter.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Liquid-entrophy">
        <h4>Liquid Entrophy</h4>
        <p>
          In “Liquid Entropy”, the interface’s characterisation is surreal,
          fluid, and immersive. It uses liquid-like textures, high-contrast
          colour gradients, and distorted 3D visuals that react instantly to
          user input. This creates creativity, mysterious, dreamy and full of
          discovery. Sound design is an important component that contributes to
          this personality, creating a deep impression on users about a vivid
          and different world.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="Conclusion">
        “7 Poems” presents formal content by using minimal visuals and slow
        pacing to create an intimate atmosphere. “Liquid Entropy”, by contrast,
        embodies a surreal character, blending fluid visuals and feedback sound
        to evoke a mysterious, dreamlike world of exploration.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Feedback</h3>
    <div class="Container">
      <div class="Seven-poems">
        <h4>7 Poems</h4>
        <p>
          “7 Poems” provides relatively gentle, rhythmic feedback that
          corresponds to each word as it appears. Users need to click on a word
          to create a pause. The rhythm of “7 Poems” feedback matches the
          overall mood of the poem, creating emotional tension. The feedback
          also fits the seriousness of the story, forcing the reader to follow
          the rhythm and engage with the poem. But it is also annoying if the
          sounds are mixed together if users forget to pause. Luckily, the site
          allows users to mute the sound in case they need a quiet space to
          ponder the content.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="Liquid-entrophy">
        <h4>Liquid Entrophy</h4>
        <p>
          In “Liquid Entropy”, feedback is instantaneous and continuous. Cursor
          movement affects visuals and sounds in real time. This creates a
          responsive, almost musical interaction where the interface feels
          alive. Furthermore, users can adjust the feedback as desired by
          clicking or dragging sliders. It is unpredictable but engaging,
          rewarding curiosity. On the other hand, it is also annoying because
          there is no built-in mute button, which can be frustrating for the
          interactive explorer.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p class="Conclusion">
        “7 Poems” offers gentle, rhythmic feedback that reflects the pace of the
        poem, fostering reflection but risking overlap if pauses are missed.
        “Liquid Entropy” delivers continuous, highly responsive audiovisual
        feedback that invites playful exploration, but the lack of a mute button
        can make the experience overwhelming.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="conclusion-cont">
      “7 Poems” and “Liquid Entropy” reflect very different design intentions.
      “7 Poems” uses clarity, simplicity, and structure to support a powerful
      emotional narrative. “Liquid Entropy” uses ambiguity, immersion, and
      sensory feedback to create an open-ended, expressive experience. Each
      interface aligns its interaction design with its artistic goals,
      demonstrating how different principles can shape user experience in
      meaningful ways.
