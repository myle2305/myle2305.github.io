      <h4>Judgements of purpose</h4>
      <p class="content">
        My desired outcome for "LookMeUp" was to create a playful and
        approachable fashion exploration and styling tool. The core purpose was
        to allow users to easily dress up a pixel character, providing a mini
        tool inspired by popular online dress-up games like Unnie Doll and
        Meiker.io. I wanted the tool to provide immediate visual and auditory
        feedback, making the act of styling enjoyable. The primary goal was to
        facilitate "playful self-styling" without the complexities of true
        avatar customization. Initially, there might have been a broader
        ambition for more personal "custom avatar" options. However, this was
        refined to focus specifically on a pre-defined pixel character because I
        think each person is a unique individual with their own identity, and
        sketching out every little detail on a human face is very difficult,
        especially when this project is not focused on visuals but on functional
        code. Therefore, I let the purpose of this project stop at changing the
        model's outfit to relax, reduce stress or as a suggestion in choosing
        outfits for women and shaping fashion style rather than trying to create
        a portrait of a specific person.

      <h4>Judgments of worth</h4>
      <ul class="content">
        The project emphasized the importance of
        <em>Mapping</em>
        and
        <em>Feedback</em>
        as foundational interaction design principles:
        <li>
          Mapping: The direct and immediate translation of selected clothing
          items onto the character. This was crucial for instantly realizing a
          "look" in a fun, direct manner, avoiding complex placement mechanics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Feedback: Audio cues in response to user actions of selecting items
          provide a more playful discovery experience.
        </li>
        These values guided decisions, ensuring that the user experience was
        fluid, rather than merely functional.
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="page" id="page3">
      <h4>Judgments of framing</h4>
      <ul class="content">
        The most important decision was to narrow the scope from a potential
        “custom avatar” generator to a dedicated pixel art makeup tool with a
        pre-defined character.
        <li>
          <b>Conceptual Limitations:</b><br />
          Avoid the complexity of copying individual appearances. This allowed
          the focus to be on the fashion aspect rather than avatar creation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Technical Limitations:</b><br />
          Realized that drawing complex edges for custom appearances would be
          technically complex and resource-intensive for the scope of the
          project. This decision was critical to refining the core makeup
          mechanics and demonstrating the effectiveness of Maps and Feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Feature Prioritization:</b><br />
          While a “save/download” functionality was planned, it was not fully
          implemented in the final version due to time and scope constraints. In
          the future, if this site is further upgraded, features such as
          expanded wardrobe catalog, color customization, animation/pose
          options, and a "random" button are identified as expansions rather
          than core requirements for the initial release.

    </div>
    <div class="page" id="page4">
      <h4>Judgments of appearance</h4>
      <ul class="content">
        The aesthetic choices for “LookMeUp” were thoughtful and consistent with
        its genres of “pixel art sandbox” and “fashion/makeup tool”.
        <li>
          <b>Style/Characters:</b><br />
          The pixel art aesthetic is central, giving it a charming and nostalgic
          feel. All characters, clothing items, hair, and UI icons were designed
          to maintain a consistent visual style.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Color Palette:</b> <br />
          The project uses primarily light pink and purple tones, which are
          evident in the background and UI elements. This choice was intended to
          create a playful, inviting, and aesthetically pleasing environment
          that fits the fashion and makeup theme.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Layout Evolution:</b><br />
          The layout has undergone several changes since the initial sketch. The
          initial wireframe designs featured a character in the center with
          clothing categories on either side or a previous horizontal layout.
          The final choice shifted to a more structured and user-friendly
          interface for selecting clothing. This decision was made because the
          current layout provides clearer categorization and more intuitive
          navigation, especially as the number of items increases. It feels less
          crowded and more organized, enhancing the overall makeup experience.
          These choices are intended to create a cohesive and visually appealing
          experience that supports the playful nature of the tool.

      <h4>Judgments of quality</h4>
      <ul class="content">
        <li>
          <b>Core Technologies:</b> The project is built using standard web
          technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for
          interactivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Interactive Visuals:</b> Konva.js to create and manipulate
          interactive visual elements on the canvas. This library provides the
          tools needed to handle layers, clicks, and render pixel art assets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Audio Feedback:</b>Tone.js is specifically integrated to manage
          sound effects, such as the “snap” sound that accompanies adding an
          item.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Asset Management:</b> All pixel art characters, clothing, hair, and
          facial features are hand-drawn by Procreate, and UI icons and sound
          effects are sourced to be copyright-free. This ensures legal
          compliance and allows for complete control over the quality of images
          and audio, maintaining a consistent pixel art aesthetic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Implementing feedback:</b> the sound after each item is added is a
          direct extension of the “Feedback” principle. This is a deliberate
          choice to make the interaction more dynamic for the user. These
          technical decisions are aimed at providing an interactive application
          that demonstrates the intended design principles.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="page" id="page6">
      <h4>Judgments of composition</h4>
      <p class="content">
        The Mapping and Feedback principles are not just features, but
        fundamental aspects that are woven into the entire user flow. The
        instantaneous appearance of items combined with immediate sensory cues
        created a seamless interaction loop. The snap sound feedback created a
        sense of completion for the user. The evolution of the current
        structured layout was a layout review aimed at improving the overall
        user experience. It balanced the character display area with clearly
        categorized wardrobe sections, making the interface feel organized. This
        decision directly impacted the user’s ability to navigate and interact
        with content. The project's layout aims for simplicity and clarity to
        emphasize the central theme of playful fashion exploration.

      <h4>Judgments of navigation:</h4>
      <ul class="content">
        <li>
          <b>Prioritizing Core Mechanics:</b> The focus was on refining the core
          clothing mechanics. This meant making sure that selecting and applying
          clothing items was as smooth and intuitive as possible. Mapping clicks
          directly to character appearance was a top priority.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>User-friendly Interface:</b> A main priority was developing a
          user-friendly interface for selecting clothing. This led to the
          evolution of the layout from the previous wireframes to the current
          design with clear categories. The goal was to make it easy for users
          to find and apply items without getting confused.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Simple over complex:</b> Choices were made to keep navigation
          simple. For example, choosing a pre-defined character instead of a
          complex avatar customization simplified the initial setup process and
          allowed users to experience clothing directly. The “Reset” button is a
          simple navigation element to start over. These priorities ensure that
          users can easily interact with the app's core functionality, providing
          a simple and easy-to-use styling experience.
