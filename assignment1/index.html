    <h1>Research on the Interactive Experience of Palat 2023</h1>
    <ol>
      <h3><li> 
        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </li></h3>
      The most noticeable element was the author's choice of a high-contrast color palette. It gives the site a really lively feel. But it's more than just the vibrancy. The way the colors are arranged, the overall layout, and how the highlighted text is layered â€“ it's all distinctive. Users who want to see how the elements interact have to move the cursor around. It sparks a sense of curiosity, making users want to explore the site further and discover what else is going on. 
      <h3><li>
        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </li></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Moved the cursor across different areas of the screen to see how elements responded. </li>

        <li>Clicked at various points to test whether clicking altered the composition.</li> 
            
        <li>Scrolled vertically to see if additional content appeared or if the interface changed in response.</li>
            
        <li>Hovered over text and images to see if there are any visual motions or interactive responses.</li> 
            
        <li>Move the cursor quickly to check if speed affected the way elements appeared.</li> 
            
        <li>Clicked on the same spot again to test whether interactions had compounding effects.</li> 
            
        <li>Paused interactions at different moments to observe whether elements continued moving or remained static.</li></ul>
      <h3><li>
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </li></h3>
      I mainly experimented with how responsive the visual and text elements were to my pointer movements. Since the interface does not use conventional navigation, I explored how interactions affected the arrangement, opacity, and layering of text and images. I tested it by moving the cursor at various speeds and in different directions. This is an easy way to understand the system's reaction and how it logically handles changes. 
      <h3><li>
        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </li></h3>
      The most common action was moving the cursor across the screen to see how elements responded and transformed.
      <h3><li>
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </li></h3>
      This interactive experience appears to be designed as a platform for open, visually driven exploration. The intended goal is to enable users to experience their own exploration of the visual aesthetics of the site through cursor movement. 
      <h3><li>
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </li></h3>
      It communicates this through an interface with high contrast color palette and unique layout arrangement. The spontaneous rearrangement of images generated by movement and clicks reinforces the concept of discovery and unpredictability, rather than the consumption of structured content.
      <h3><li>
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </li></h3>
      The experience seems designed for short but repeated interactions. Users should be able to explore it briefly, leave, and return to try new interactions, rather than interacting with it in a single, continuous session.
      <h3><li>
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </li></h3>
      The lack of clear instructions coupled with the unpredictable interactions suggests an open-ended approach. Users are not guided through specific interaction steps but are instead encouraged to explore the color and layout movements and experience the aesthetic space of color within the website.
      <h3><li>
        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?</li></h3>
        The experience references glitch aesthetics, abstract digital art, and experimental typography, often seen in net art and early web experiments.
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </li></h3>
      <h3><li>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</li></h3>
        It suggests that playful and exploratory interactions like Palat Tuntaopas are more fun than goal oriented. Unlike traditional websites where navigation is structured, this experience encourages curiosity and exploration. But at the same time, the purpose of the website must be carefully considered, for example, shopping or information-seeking websites need clear directions to help users achieve their goals quickly and efficiently, while entertainment websites like this need unique creativity, which creates curiosity and enjoyment for the user to experience the website.
    <h3><li>
        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </li></h3>
      The references evoke feelings of disorientation, experimentation, and immersion. Users may feel either delighted or confused by the dynamic nature of the interaction.
        <h3><li>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?</li></h3>
        The unpredictability of responses can be frustrating, especially when trying to control or predict outcomes. Without clear feedback, interactions can sometimes become uncomfortable.
      <h3><li>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</li></h3>
      The most satisfying aspect is that the visual transitions are triggered by simple movements, creating a sense of initiative and artistic collaboration between the user and the interface. Furthermore, the author's choice of colors is quite interesting, which makes the interaction more fun.
